# Movie Website
A Movie Trailer website, filled in with 6 movies I enjoy. 
The Movies display Movie Art, Title, Tagline, and Estimated Duration. 
Clicking on the movie pulls up a trailer for the film from Youtube.

To open website, open and run the entertainment_center.py file.
The html file will then be create in the same directory as entertainment_center.py
The html file will also be automatically opened in the default web browser
